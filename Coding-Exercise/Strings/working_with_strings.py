# John loves analysing textual information
# He often reads short stories and then tries to find the longest word in such stories.
# Doing this manually takes a long time so we'd like to help him automate the task. \

# Note: You are provided an example of a short story in the code editor. 
# The example story should not be part of your solution: it is just there to help you.

# Write a function named get_longest_word which accepts a single string argument.
# The function should return the longest word in the given string. Assume that words in a string can be separated with spaces,
# commas, new line characters or full stops. This means that abbreviated forms with apostrophes (e.g. I'm) are considered to be a single word. 
# If there is more than one word with the maximum number of characters, return the first such word that exists in the string.

# Example: For input Once I'm awaken, I'll sacrifice your soul to the ruler of darkness. the output should be sacrifice.
