# Using "random"
# Let's write a simple function that will help organise lotteries. 
# The function will generate a list of random numbers (to simulate lottery tickets), 
# and it will also choose one number from the generated list (to simulate the winning ticket).

# Write a function named generate_tickets that will accept two integer arguments: ticket_count and max_number.
# The function should return a tuple with exactly two elements:

# first element: a list of random unique integer numbers in the range from 0 (inclusive) to max_number (exclusive);
# The number of elements is provided in the ticket_count argument

# second element: one random element from the generated list of numbers

# Calling generate_tickets(5, 10) should generate 5 random unique integers in the range from 0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive).
# An example return value for this invocation could be:

# ([2, 8, 9, 3, 0], 8)

# In this case, the random numbers are: 2, 8, 9, 3, 0. The winning number is 8.

# Note: You can assume that the arguments of the function are always correct (i.e. you always get two correct integers as the input arguments).
